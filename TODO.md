## Considered and not built

**SingleFile for real archiving.** A screenshot is pixels: no selectable text, no working links, no
grep, several MB each. For pages genuinely worth preserving,
https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile inlines every image, stylesheet and font into one
`.html` that opens offline forever. A mature extension — install it alongside rather than
reimplementing it here.

**Screenshots outside the Downloads folder.** Not possible: the `downloads` API resolves filenames
against the browser's download directory and rejects `..`. The subfolder is configurable in the
popup; make it a symlink if the files need to live elsewhere.

**Judging bare URLs.** The card deck originally dealt unread links. It does not work —
`x.com/i/status/2086188444317819246` carries no information, which is the reason this extension
exists. Reading now precedes judging, and the deck runs over captures only.
